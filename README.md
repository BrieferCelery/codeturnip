# R15 Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your app
This application was built using the Model-View-Controller(MVC) architecture patten. The app breakdown is as follows -

## Product:
The product model organises the data of a product such as name, price, image and supply. The product model also validates the presence of each data field making sure all fields have a value before storing it. The products controller handles all CRUD operations for product data. Before a page renders the controller ensures data security by allowing access to certain CRUD features if a user is signed in or has special permissions. If they do not have permission they will be redirected to the sign in page. For example an admin user must be the current user in order to use the edit, create and destroy features. The product views present the product data. The views will display actions to the user based on their role for example if a user is not an admin the new product button will not display on the page.

## User:

The user model was created the [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) a gem that handles user authentication. The user model handles user data such as email and id. User also connects to the role model to handle special user roles(admin). The user views are automatically generated by Devise and handle user registration, sign in and error handling. The email and password fields have certain conditions that must be met in order to register a user such as minimum password length and the presense of the '@' symbol when entering an email.

## Role: 
The role model was created automatically by the gem [Rolify](https://github.com/RolifyCommunity/rolify). The role model connects to the user model to apply special user priveledges. The model establishes a relationship with the user model through a join table. This section was unchanged for this application 

## Ability:
The ability class defines the abilities that each user has - an admin user has the ability to create, update, destroy data where a regular user can read all data. This file was automatically generated by the gem [cancancan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan)

## Post:
Post model gives the user the ability to write to write and display a public post about a
